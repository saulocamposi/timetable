How many tennis balls fit into a Boeing 787 Dreamliner?

Considering that each ball is a sphere with diameter of: ds
If I encapsule each ball in a box so each box is : ba = 6 * (ds * ds)

Considering that each person in a plane could be in a box that would be a container: 
container per person

Imagine inside of the plane as a big rectangle that fits many containers of persons.

So the number of balls is the quantity of balls inside a person container, multiplied to the 
capacity of the big rectangle to receive person container.
